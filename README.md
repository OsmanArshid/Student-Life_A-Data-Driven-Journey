## Project Overview
This project examines various aspects of student life at LUMS using a combination of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and modeling. The findings aim to provide actionable insights on how students balance academics, social activities, and mental health.

---

## Objectives
1. Explore academic workloads across schools and their relationship with extracurricular activities.
2. Identify how students prioritize social and extracurricular commitments relative to academics.
3. Analyze the impact of academic workload and socialization on counseling trends.
4. Investigate stress levels and time management habits across schools and academic years.

## Data Workflow
1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: 
   - Loading raw survey data.
   - Removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing patterns and trends in academic workload, social activities, and mental health.

3. **Modeling and Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Testing research questions using statistical and machine learning models.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Creating insightful plots to communicate findings effectively.

---

## Key Research Questions
1. How do academic workloads and extracurricular activities vary across different schools?
2. Which kinds of extracurriculars are students willing to prioritize or sacrifice for academics?
3. What is the impact of workload and socialization on the likelihood of seeking counseling?
4. How do time management and stress levels differ across academic years and schools?

---

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Understanding trends through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilized to present data in a clear, intuitive format.
- **Modeling**: Applied regression and classification models to test hypotheses.
- **Insights**: Focused on actionable conclusions for stakeholders.

---

## Key Findings
1. Students from certain schools have significantly higher academic workloads but reduced social engagements.
2. Sacrifices in extracurricular activities vary widely across schools and academic years.
3. A strong correlation exists between workload/socialization and counseling likelihood.
4. Stress management practices and time allocation vary significantly among majors.
